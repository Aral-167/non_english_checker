# Non-English-Character Checker
This is a Non-English-Character Checker to see if your text has English characters in it. This occurred to me when I was ordering my PCB for highway I had to put in my address and it said you have to put the address in English, and I was like "What?" do I have to translate the street names etc. to English because I was almost sure ı didn't use any Turkish characters (I know I shouldn't use Turkish characters because foreign computers can't compile Turkish characters.) So I checked and checked and finally realized I wrote cavusbası instead of cavusbasi. If I had an app like this I could have done this in seconds. I know that it's not for everyone and everytime but for those small times you need it it's gonna be there for you.
## How to use it?
Just enter the text in the box and it'll tell you wether or not is there a not english character and if there is it'll show you where it is.
